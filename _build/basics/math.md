# Basic Math Operations

You can use Python as a calculator to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

| Operator	    |          Description                   | Syntax  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|---------|
| +             | Addition: adds two operands            | x + y   |
| -             | Subtraction: subtracts two operands    | x - y   |
| *             | Multiplication: multiplies two operands| x * y   |
| /             | Division (float): divides the first operand by the second | x / y
| //             | Division (floor): divides the first operand by the second| x // y  |
| %             | Modulus: remainder when first operand is divided by the second | x % y
| **             | Exponential: Takes first operand to the power of second operand | x ** y   |
